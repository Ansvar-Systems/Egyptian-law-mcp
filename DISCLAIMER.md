# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship (علاقة محامي-موكل)
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer (محامي/محامية), legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Egyptian Bar Association (نقابة المحامين المصرية — Niqabat al-Muhamin al-Misriyya) must comply with applicable professional conduct rules (Law No. 17 of 1983 on Attorneys) when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Official Gazette — Al-Jarida Al-Rasmiyya / الجريدة الرسمية, and the Egyptian legislation portal)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force (ساري المفعول) and has not been amended (معدّل) or repealed (ملغى)
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions in both Arabic and, where available, English
4. Consulting case law (أحكام) from the Court of Cassation (محكمة النقض) and other courts for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official Egyptian legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official Gazette (الجريدة الرسمية)** | Authoritative | Official publication of laws and decrees |
| **Egyptian legislation portal** | Authoritative | Statute text, codes (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources** | Supplementary | Cross-references, translations (verify independently) |
| **Treaty databases** | Authoritative for international law | International obligations, African Union, Arab League agreements |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources and unofficial translations are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, translation inaccuracies, outdated information, or incomplete coverage. The Arabic text of the Official Gazette is the only legally binding version.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases and official repositories** such as:

- Egyptian official legislation databases, Middle East Law Library, LexisNexis Middle East

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations, and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Egyptian law changes continuously through new statutes (قوانين), presidential decrees (قرارات رئاسية), ministerial decrees (قرارات وزارية), and court decisions (أحكام)
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the Official Gazette
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended (معدّل) after the last database update
  - Repealed (ملغى) but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional rules (أحكام انتقالية) affecting its applicability
  - Affected by Constitutional Court (المحكمة الدستورية العليا) rulings on constitutionality
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law** -- Coverage of Court of Cassation (محكمة النقض), Supreme Constitutional Court (المحكمة الدستورية العليا), and lower court decisions is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording
3. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary (فقه), or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative rulings largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of parliamentary debates (مجلس النواب) and explanatory memoranda (المذكرة الإيضاحية)
6. **Arabic-only provisions** -- Some provisions may only be available in English translation, which is not the authoritative text

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary (فقه) and legislative history, interpretation may be incorrect
- **Translation Limitations**: English translations may not capture the full legal meaning of Arabic provisions
- **International Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess African Union, Arab League, or bilateral treaty compliance

## No Warranties
